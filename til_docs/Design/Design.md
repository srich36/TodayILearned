#### Icons

- Font icons are icons from fonts that support ligatures, where svg icons are made out of svg's
  - svg's load faster

#### Color

- Pallette: A collection of colors, i.e. hues and shades

## General Guidelines

- Links should have specific text (e.g. [learn more](#)), not something like [click here](#)
- `normalize.css` - A library that provides a standard set of CSS styles for HTML elements
  - While you don't have to use `normalize.css`, you should set standard sensible styles for DOM elements
- Use radio buttons only when the user needs to see all the options. Otherwise, consider using something like a dropdown
