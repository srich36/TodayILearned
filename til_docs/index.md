# Collection of Today I Learned (TIL)

This repository serves as a random collection of TIL's over a random period of days. Some of these were review and others were new concepts. Hope you enjoy!

For any suggestions, corrections, or issues, feel free to file an issue on my today I learned [github repository](https://github.com/srich36/TodayILearned/issues).
