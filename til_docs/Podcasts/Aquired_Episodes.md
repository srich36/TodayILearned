## Zoom

- Founder/CEO: Eric Yuan

## SpaceX

- Cut all the subcontractors to the subcontractors to the subcontractors out of the aerospace market to remove dead weight and accumulating cost-plus pricing (where everyone takes 30%)
  - Reduced cost by a factor of 10
  - If you ever see a cost-plus model run: they have an incentive to make something as expensive as possible
- Green-lighted falcon 9 (9 Merlin engines) before Falcon 1 even succeeded
  - Engine was brilliantly designed to be modular so this could be possible
- Investing 10's of billions into Starlink - a consortium of 12,000 LEO satellites to provide low-cost internet all over the globe
  - Traditionally satellite internet has come from GEO satellites and thus is much slower

## Google Maps

## WeWork

- Founder/CEO: Adam Neumann
  - Refused to give up any control
  - Tanked his own company
- VC's - especially Softbank's vision fund - were willing to dump capital in this because they needed to offload funds and they were securing the assets against office buildings
- Softbank inflated value so much since they were the only ones willing to invest, IPO got canceled, terrible terrible management story

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

## Sequoia Capital

- Founder: Don Valentine
  - Basically helped revolutionize the VC industry
- Focuses on huge market potential and huge ideas, founders kind of second since they can always supplement help
- Refer to investments as _partnerships_ to build great companies with
- In the dot-com crash Sequoia **refused** to let the fund lose money - cutting management fees and devoting a ton of effort to salvaging returns - over a matter of principle
  - This developed a ton of customer loyalty and a huge respect for the firm

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

## WhatsApp

- Founder: Jan Koum
- Nailed product/market fit + value proposition -> send messages to people across the globe for \$.99 instead of the ridiculous plans telephone providers offered
  - Text messages were actually limited to 120 characters because that was the extra space available in consistent pings from network towers to cell phones. Therefore text messages offered NO additional cost to the telephone providers
- \$22 billion acquisition that has yet to be monetized but was a great takeout play by Facebook
- Hated advertising on the platform and got in a HUGE fight with Facebook over this, leaving like \$800 million on the table

## The Lean Startup and LTSE

## TikTok

## Disney Plus

- CEO: Bob Iger
  - Transformed the way Disney was run and brought them out of their dark days
  - Acquired Pixar, Lucas Films, Fox, to bring great animation technology and IP into the studio
- The Disney flywheel - centering around content creation - allows them to draw a significant amount of extra revenue from merchandising, parks, etc. from their IP.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

## Venmo

- Founder/CEO: Andrew Kortina
- There is no business model on peer-to-peer payments since cash is free
  - The only business model is attracting peer-to-peer customers to incentivize merchants to use your platform as a payments option and take a cut
    - The PayPal business model
- Acquired by Braintree (for not that much) then PayPal and would not have survived without acquisitions
- Did a really weird and random marketing stunt - Brian uses venmo - where people had no idea who Brian was and thus it went viral

## Netflix

- CEO: Reid Hastings
- Two separate eras: DVD rental and streaming
- Team mentality - not a family - if you are not performing they will have to let you go because it's not fair to the rest of the team
- Blockbuster actually had great management but corporate raider Carl Icahn kicked out CEO over comp. dispute and installed new guy who "didn't believe in internet businesses" and wanted to bring back the hayday of brick and mortar stores lol
  - Blockbuster online was going to beat Netflix - Netflix even capitulated and offered to sell to Blockbuster - before this self-inflicted wound happened

## Tesla

## Uber

- Theme of companies IPO'ing in the A+ era (2018-2019 ish) is because companies were staying private longer. Where previously it was 3-4 years post-founding until going public, now it is closer to 10-12 years. Thus companies founded post-2008 recession were all IPO'ing around the same time
- Co-founder/CEO: Travis Kalanick, Co-founder: Garret Camp
  - Travis got scorched on lawsuits before Uber thus leading to his personality
- Uber for the first couple years was in the black-car market, Lyft came in and did borderline-illegal peer-to-peer ridesharing which blew up the unit economics
  - Thus it was a race to outlast each other and raise as much capital as possible so the unit economics could return to profitability
- Uber had a massive culture problem in 2017 and Dara Khosrowshahi became CEO and helped fix the culture
- Uber's A+ possibility is having drivers be 100% occupied between Eats/Rideshare, etc. so then they only use Uber and not a competitor ;like Lyft. This will turn the unit economics in their favor.

## Pinterest

- Founder/Eventual CEO: Ben Silverman
- Key theme: Pinterest did a great job investing in their growth _before_ they actually grew

- Women drove a lot of the success at the company throughout all stages of its life
  - They had a ton of women engineers which matched the demographics of their user base and really pushed the product forward
- There is a lot of value in keeping a team together
  - You begin to learn everyone's strengths and weaknesses and get quicker at building things together

## ESPN

- Theme: constantly be analyzing your business model: paying cable providers vs them paying you
- Be the thing that provides value not the commodity
- Capital cities buys ABC worth more than their entire company “minnow swallows whale” -> capital cities then becomes ABC
- ESPN created value then captured it (March Madness, Sunday Night Football, Monday Night Football are all things they essentially created) then captured it with their network
- They didn’t ride the wave, they created it
  - Business model innovation coupled with riding/creating a wave is key to creating a massive

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

## Snap

- Theme: don't be afraid of a large incumbent launching your feature - it will bring you publicity (like when Facebook launching a Snap competitor)

## Softbank

- Founder: Masayoshi Son (Masa)
  - He has an incredible story and has done amazingly well in business - even surpassing Bill Gates in wealth at one point during the tech bubble
  - Once the tech bubble burst he lost more money than anyone in history - \$70 billion
- Huge on getting in-person meetings: meeting with McDonald's businessman, meeting with Steve Jobs for phone idea/becoming the exclusive provider in Japan
- Masa made a $20 million investment in Alibaba which turned into $60 billion
  - Could be the most successful investment of all time
- Softbank went into broadband, telecommunications, investments, etc. because after the tech bubble burst Masa realized that stable cash flow is **really** important in building sustainable businesses
- Softbank is well-known for its Vision Fund, a \$100 billion fund for growth capital
  - This is by far the biggest fund ever raised
  - Regardless of how successful it ends up being, this will generate \$15 billion in management fees by the end of the 12-15 year lockup period -> stable cash flow
  - One of the reasons they were so successful in raising this capital is because it is one of the only avenues for massive wealth funds like the Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund to generate returns
    - You can't deploy that much capital anywhere else

## Github

- The original version of Git came after the main distributed version control company revoked its free licenses for the open-source community
  - Linus built the first prototype of git in like a week
- Theme: the wax and wane of technologies - centralized/decentralized, client-server/local, these go through cycles
- Theme: It is **really** important to nail the line for freemium models at the right point where it benefits the overall product
  - Github: free public repos but paid private repos
    - The free version which benefits the open-source community and the Github product as a whole. For companies protecting their IP they have to pay. This is a perfect freemium model.
  - Zoom: free calls up to 40 mins
    - Free customers can just start another call
    - The ideal business meeting, however, is 45 minutes thus the 40 minute freemium model, encouraging enterprise users to pay

- They used Twitter to amplify the messages of people evanelizing Slack
- Nailed their freemium model
  - number of searchable and archivable messages instead of number of users
    - This encourages people to show the functionality to coworkers
- DL (Direct Listing) vs. IPO
  - No additional shares issued so there is no dilution
  - Great for companies who are profitable and don't need money
  - No lockup period for DPO's. Employees/people can liquidate stock
- There are two ways to make money: "bundling and unbundling"
- They understand the customer funnel really well
  - They find triggers where customers won't churn (2000 messages per team for Slack)
  - Therefore they designed the product around having teams reach 2000 messages since they know once they hit that point they won't churn
- They were their own first customer
  - This way they learned what the customers wanted
- Customer acquisition cost at its most basic sense is (new customers) divided by marketing dollars spend
- Started in Canada
