# Overview

- *Protobuf* is a serialization format often used for service<->service communication
- Requires both the client and server to have the service definition files (`.proto` files) which are then
code-generated into classes with accessor and getter properties in the language of both the client and server
- Often used in conjunction with `gRPC` for communication between services
