### IP Addresses

IPv4 addresses are 4 byte (32 bit) values that describe a host machine. The four bytes are written in dotted notation, e.g. `140.2.1.12`. Each set of 8 bits can range from 0 to 255: `0.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`. 

There are different classes of IP addresses which detail how many of the 32 bits correspond to the `Network ID` and how many of the 32 bits correspond to the `Host ID`. Class B IP addresses which are probably the most common have 16 bits for the `Network ID` (the first 2 dotted stanzas) and `16 bits` for the `Host ID`. E.g. `140.2.1.12` has a `Network ID` of `140.2` and a `Host ID` of `1.12` if divided up this way.
