# Overview

- *OCI* (Open Container Initiative) defines a standard image format for containers
  - Therefore all container runtimes (systems that provide an abstraction layer over the hardware for these images to run 
  on) that implement the OCI specification can run images produced from a variety of tools (docker, podman, etc.)
- `containerd` is the most popular container runtime now, even docker uses this
