# Overview

- Determination can grow over time -- there are people who start a startup that are okay with it getting aquired for a few million and then change
gears and want to grow it far greater than that
- Sales mostly depends on effort, not abilities
- Defaults are **enormously powerful** because they operate without any conscious choice
  - e.g. Getting a job is a default rather than starting a company
- A common mistake is getting involved with (co-founder, employee, investor, etc.) with people you may have some misgivings with but you think is impressive
  - **Trust your instincts about people**
  - Work with people you genuinely like and have known long enough to be sure about
- You don't need to know a lot about starting a startup, you only need to know a lot about your users
  - It's more important to **build** than to go through the motions of starting a startup
- Noob mistake: Fundraising is **not** the measure of success for startups
