# General

- The best way to find a good idea is to fall in love with a problem
- **Just Google the problem to see if someone has worked on the problem before**
- Ideas that make ideas seem bad but are actually good
  - Ideas that are hard to get started
  - Ideas that are in a boring space
    - Because a lot of founders shy away from this these ideas have a better hit rate than "fun" ideas
  - Ideas with existing competitors
- Trying to think of startup ideas is often the worst way to come up with ideas because you invent problems that don't exist
  - See Paul Graham [essay](https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html#:~:text=It's%20to%20look%20for%20problems,others%20realize%20are%20worth%20doing.)
- The best startup ideas are ones that a few people want badly rather than ones that a lot of people want a bit
- "Live in the future, then build what's missing/what's interesting"

### Common Mistakes
- Common mistakes
  - Building something that doesn't solve a problem for real users -- a solution in search of a problem
  - Getting stuck on a "tarpit" idea -- ideas that get you stuck
    - Widespread problem that lots of founders encounter
    - Problems where there is a structural reason why you can't solve the problem (e.g. an app that makes it easier to go to events with friends)
        - The common theme here is ideas that are harder than they seem
    - Make sure you don't just hop on the first idea and evaluate
    - Don't wait for the perfect idea

### Idea Evaluation

- Evaluating an idea
  - **Do you have founder market fit?**
  - How big is the market?
  - How acute is the problem?
  - Do you have competition? Counterintuitively, good startup ideas have competition
    - If going up against entrenched competition you want to have a unique insight
  - Why now?
- A great situation is a problem with a bunch of competitors but everyone had missed something or the other products suck

### Idea Generation

- The best way to have startup ideas is to notice them organically rather than thinking through a process
- If you are running a process for idea generation
  - Start with ideas your team is actually good at 
  - Start with a problem you have encountered -- especially one that you are uniquely going to see
  - Think of things you personally wish existed
  - Look for things in the world that have changed recently
  - Look for new variants of already successful companies
  - Talk to people and ask what problems they have. This actually takes a lot of skill
  - Look for big industries that seem broken
- It's often hard to tell if a startup idea is good or not
  - You just have to launch it and find out
