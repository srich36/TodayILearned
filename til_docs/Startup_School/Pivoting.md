# Overview

## Tarpit Ideas

- Ideas that a lot of founders encounter but are time wasters
- **If you find yourself in a tarpit idea you have to pivot out it quickly**
- Tarpit ideas attract founders because they are wide open problems! But there are a ton of failed companies that have already tried them!
- Most tarpit ideas are consumer ideas
  - The bar is **really** high in consumer products
    - You basically have to have **insane** traction with these products almost immediately without any marketing to be a really iconic consumer company
    - This is really hard to do nowadays with how many competing products are out
  - Timing tends to be really important in consumer
- Tarpit ideas will likely get some positive feedback and you'll want to work on it
  - A true tarpit is one that you will be defensive about when you get challenged on it (thus the tar part of tarpit)
- Theory:
  - Startup ideas have supply and demand
  - Supply
    - Some ideas lots of founders want to work on
    - Some ideas are hard to start and not many people want to work on
  - Demand
    - Demand for an unlaunched undifferentiated social app is 0
    - Demand for high quality software in a niche industry is really high
  - Tarpit ideas have the largest oversupply of a startup idea relative to demand
  - The best pivots are when founders recognize they are on the wrong side of the supply and demand curve and pivot to something that is on a better space on the supply/demand curve

### Tarpit Examples

- An app to discover new things (e.g. events, restaraunts, concerts, music, etc.)
  - The # of restaraunts, etc. are by definition limited which makes this idea very hard to work
- Software to help people bet, gamble, or trade
- Web3 -- this theoretically opens up the possibility for everything to be rebuilt
  - This makes it a sexy idea to work on but this is a very hard problem to work on
