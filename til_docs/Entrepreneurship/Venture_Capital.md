# For Companies

## Guidelines

- Each round you generally sell 20-30% of your company
  - You have to do the math: even if you grow from a $20 million to $150 million business but need to take on more seed rounds, it may have just been more time for the same monetary exit
- "Let's keep in touch" is generally a no
  - Venture capitalists just want to keep their options open
