## Zoom

- Founder/CEO: Eric Yuan

## SpaceX

- Cut all the subcontractors to the subcontractors to the subcontractors out of the aerospace market to remove dead weight and accumulating cost-plus pricing (where everyone takes 30%)
  - Reduced cost by a factor of 10
  - If you ever see a cost-plus model run: they have an incentive to make something as expensive as possible
- Green-lighted falcon 9 (9 Merlin engines) before Falcon 1 even succeeded
  - Engine was brilliantly designed to be modular so this could be possible
- Investing 10's of billions into Starlink - a consortium of 12,000 LEO satellites to provide low-cost internet all over the globe
  - Traditionally satellite internet has come from GEO satellites and thus is much slower

## Google Maps

## WeWork

- Founder/CEO: Adam Neumann
  - Refused to give up any control
  - Tanked his own company
- VC's - especially Softbank's vision fund - were willing to dump capital in this because they needed to offload funds and they were securing the assets against office buildings
- Softbank inflated value so much since they were the only ones willing to invest, IPO got canceled, terrible terrible management story

## Sequoia Capital

- Founder: Don Valentine
  - Basically helped revolutionize the VC industry
- Focuses on huge market potential and huge ideas, founders kind of second since they can always supplement help
- Refer to investments as _partnerships_ to build great companies with
- In the dot-com crash Sequoia **refused** to let the fund lose money - cutting management fees and devoting a ton of effort to salvaging returns - over a matter of principle
  - This developed a ton of customer loyalty and a huge respect for the firm

## WhatsApp

- Founder: Jan Koum
- Nailed product/market fit + value proposition -> send messages to people across the globe for \$.99 instead of the ridiculous plans telephone providers offered
  - Text messages were actually limited to 120 characters because that was the extra space available in consistent pings from network towers to cell phones. Therefore text messages offered NO additional cost to the telephone providers
- \$22 billion acquisition that has yet to be monetized but was a great takeout play by Facebook
- Hated advertising on the platform and got in a HUGE fight with Facebook over this, leaving like \$800 million on the table

## The Lean Startup and LTSE

## TikTok

## Disney Plus

- CEO: Bob Iger
  - Transformed the way Disney was run and brought them out of their dark days

- The Disney flywheel - centering around content creation - allows them to draw a significant amount of extra revenue from merchandising, parks, etc. from their IP.

## Venmo

- Founder/CEO: Andrew Kortina
- There is no business model on peer-to-peer payments since cash is free
  - The only business model is attracting peer-to-peer customers to incentivize merchants to use your platform as a payments option and take a cut
    - The PayPal business model
- Acquired by Braintree (for not that much) then PayPal and would not have survived without acquisitions
- Did a really weird and random marketing stunt - Brian uses venmo - where people had no idea who Brian was and thus it went viral

## Netflix

- CEO: Reid Hastings
- Two separate eras: DVD rental and streaming
- Team mentality - not a family - if you are not performing they will have to let you go because it's not fair to the rest of the team
- Blockbuster actually had great management but corporate raider Carl Icahn kicked out CEO over comp. dispute and installed new guy who "didn't believe in internet businesses" and wanted to bring back the hayday of brick and mortar stores lol
  - Blockbuster online was going to beat Netflix - Netflix even capitulated and offered to sell to Blockbuster - before this self-inflicted wound happened

## Tesla

## Uber

- Theme of companies IPO'ing in the A+ era (2018-2019 ish) is because companies were staying private longer. Where previously it was 3-4 years post-founding until going public, now it is closer to 10-12 years. Thus companies founded post-2008 recession were all IPO'ing around the same time
- Co-founder/CEO: Travis Kalanick, Co-founder: Garret Camp
  - Travis got scorched on lawsuits before Uber thus leading to his personality
- Uber for the first couple years was in the black-car market, Lyft came in and did borderline-illegal peer-to-peer ridesharing which blew up the unit economics
  - Thus it was a race to outlast each other and raise as much capital as possible so the unit economics could return to profitability
