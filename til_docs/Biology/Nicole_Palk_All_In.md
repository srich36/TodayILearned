- Background: Offer was a professor of viral gene therapy and spun off a company
- Nicole spun out a company *Siren* that attempts to create a generic gene therapy

## Gene Therapy

- *Gene Therapy* is using viruses as medicine
- Eras of modern medicine 
    1. Chemical medicine. Small molecules in medicines that can be produced in a lab.
       - The vast majority of medicines 
    2. Protein medicines. Enzymes
       - Cut out the middle-man -- we don't need a chemical that alters the shape and function of proteins. Just give the protein as a drug itself.
       - Enzyme treatments, antibody therapies, Humira (for arthritis -- the most successful drug of all time)
    3. Living medicines. 
       - Use viruses, bacteria, cells, etc. to impart changes in your body
       - Gene and cell therapies
       - Why? Other types of medicine go through your entire body and **we don't always want that**
         - Chemo for example
       - What if you could target cells specifically?
       - With this we can engineer in logic circuits (e.g. if statements, loops, etc.) to get really precise delivery of drugs
- Really common misconception -- all viruses are bad
  - Very few viruses make you sick
  - But viruses are really good at getting inside of you
    - These viruses can be used to deliver different kinds of medicines
- Where are we now?
  - A **bunch** of companies are working in gene therapy for various diseases and on their way to FDA approval
- Typically, the therapies so far have only been rare, single-gene disorders
  - Can we use this on broader problem spaces
  - Could you use a virus to *cure* cancer?
  - Conventional gene therapy takes 10-15 years, costs a few billion, and treats rare diseases
- Immunotherapy - retraining your immune system to fight cancer 
  - You get large tumors because an individual tumor cell may randomly generate a mutation that will give it essentially an invisibility cloak so your immune system can't detect it
- Could you make a universal gene therapy?
  - Nicole set off to try this
  - Essentially they try to deliver a type of cancer announcing payload that can alert the immune system that there is cancer so it can fight it off
  - **This therapy was able to cure brain cancer in mice**
- Types of gene therapy
  - Gene transfer -- copying a section of DNA into a place that is missing it
  - Gene therapy -- editing an existing mutation in place
- Every virus on the planet has a size that they can carry
  - AAV viruses (what Nicole works on) can only package about 4.75 KB of dna
    - One KB is a *kilobase* which means 1000 base pairs of DNA
  - About 80% of gene transfer therapies fit within 4.75 KB
  - Gene editing isn't size constrained because you don't need to send the whole DNA
  - These viruses can carry the arbitrary strands of DNA that you want to put into the genes
- The tech is there today to go in and change one A to a C for an example

### What Else Could We Do With Viruses

- There is a rare mutation in a gene called *DEC2* that when you have it you only need 4 hours of sleep
  - A gene therapy can easily give that to other people
  - We could do this today
- Could use viruses to regenerate tissue in your joints
- Far out, could engineer humanity to withstand life on harsher environments like Mars
  - There are ethical considerations of making super humans but this is still incredible technology
- Night vision, metabolize food that you normally can't metabolize, eat anything that could taste very good to you
  - This is super easy with the current technology 
- Beauty applications -- male pattern baldness, wrinkles, cellulite
- Mental health fixes

### Regulatory 

- Today, it takes like 10-15 years to get your first program 
  - This is mostly regulatory wait
- There are about 18 months of paperwork to file for page 1, lots of back and forth for data readouts, etc.
- For things like sleep reduction, you'd probably need an ethical review board
  - **Because this is not a disease**
  - The FDA only lets you spin up clinical trials for things that are *disease states*

### Bottlnecks

- Manufacturing -- we can't make enough of the therapies we need
  - Manufacturing at scale continues to be a huge problem
  - We need more mechanical engineers working on this
    - We have been making chemicals at scale for 40 years, but making viruses at scale is not a solved problem
- **Access to capital** -- the average viral gene therapy is like $2-3 billion
  - Usually after seed but before you get clinical readouts people are nervous to give you capital 
  - People don't want to invest when it is really risky and takes a long time to get a return
  
### Examples

- Congential blindness, from missing a single protein in their eye. Gene therapy produced this protein and cured them
  - These changes could be seen within 7 days
- Gene therapy can already
  - Prevent paralysis
  - Stop blindness
  - Eliminate malaria
