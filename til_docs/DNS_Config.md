# DNS Records

- A `CNAME` record is an alias that points from one domain name alias to the actual domain name. On namecheap this can be done by mapping the `www` subdomain to the actual domain name for example.
- An `A` record maps the canonical (actual) domain name to the IP address hosting the website

Recall, when you purchase a domain you purchase a top level domain (TLD) which is `<domain>.<TLD>` (e.g. `example.com`). `www` is a subdomain so you must map that alias to the actual canonical domain name, which in this case is `example.com`.
