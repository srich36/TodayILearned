# Overview

- [Docs](https://cva.style/docs)
    - This is a library that helps create **variants** of a component with CSS
- A *variant* is a particular style of a component that is applied based on certain conditions
- Using `class-variant-authority` you can dynamically apply these variants to your components based on your state or props
- `cva` takes in a list of classes **all** variants apply for and then also a set of variants that will add additional colors
