# Overiew

- Yarn is better for monorepos (`yarn workspace`) than `npm`
- `npm` has a `version` command that will increment the version of a `package.json` and create a git tag
- Rails encrypts secrets and ships those secrets with the code -- webconf does something similar for JS
    - Webconf is not public online but is an interesting idea
