# Testing

- end-to-end test: Test the entire flow of the application - both frontend and backend together
  
### Jest

- Jest is a test runner that allows you to access the DOM via `jsdom`, an approximation of the browser
- You can mock anything with `jest.spyOn` for API calls

### Snapshot Testing

- Allows you to save rendered component output and ensure a change to the component is explicitly committed
