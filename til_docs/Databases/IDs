# Overview

- Autoincrement leads to scaling issues down the line and can risk leaking information
- UUIDv7 is a sortable uuid based on timestamp
  - UUIDs don't work well in URLs though
- [TypeID](https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid/blob/main/README.md) gives you the best of both worlds (sortable IDs, Stripe like prefix IDs)
    - This is just an extension of UUIDv7
    - These can be decoded to get the original UUIDv7 back
    - **Sean's thoughts: Use typeIDs everywhere**
- [KSUID](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid) is another standard similar to TypeID
