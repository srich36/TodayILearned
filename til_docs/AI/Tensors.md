# Overview

- Tensors can be dynamic or static
  - Dynamic - tensors may have different shapes
  - Static - all tensors have the same shape
- In Deeplake shapes are represented as intervals where the upper and lower bounds of shape are recorded
- A tensor is just a multi-dimensional array that you can do matrix math on
  - This isn't just specific to ML: Stress tensor - a tensor that describes the stress at a point in a material
