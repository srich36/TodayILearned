# Overview

- Vision models can process both images and natural language
- A vision language model generally consists of:
  - An image encoder
  - A text encoder
  - A way to fuse the two encodings together
- The latest models predominantly adopt image and text encoders with transformers to separately or jointly learn
text and image features
