# Notes

- The author was the lead international kidnapping hostage negotiator
- Asking open questions buys you time in the negotiation, as the other party has to figure out how to answer
  - You can keep asking the same few open-ended questions in a row over and over, and the other party might get worn out answering them
- **Humans are not purely rational**
  - *Loss Aversion* - people are more likely to act to avert a loss than to acheive an equal gain
  - *Framing Effect* - people react differently based on how something is framed (e.g. going from 90 to 100% vs. 45 to 55%)
- Because of this, you cannot rely on a purely rational model for negotiation (e.g. the book *Getting to Yes*)
- Often times **emotional** situations drive negotiations, rather than rational situations
  - This is especially true in hostage negotiations
- You need to calm people down, establish rapport, gain trust, elicit the verbalization of needs, and persuade the other party of your empathy
- **Listening is the key** -- people want to be understood and accepted
- Negotiation does **not** mean browbeating someone down
- **"Negotiation is not a battle, it's a process of discovery**
- **Negotiation is everywhere**
  - From talking to airport counter agents
  - To business deals
  - To general sales
  - Car sales
  - **It doesn't have to feel like a negotiation to use these tactics**
  - It's just about getting to an outcome you want in any situation!
- Good negotiators recognize that their job is to gently guide their coutnerpart to discover their goal as his own
  - **A lot of times you want your counterpart to think they came up with the goals themselves**
    - Kinda like inception
- **Silence is powerful. Use effective pauses**
  - People feel awkward and compelled to speak
- **It's important to train yourself to recognize the situations that are negotiations -- and that you can use these tactics in**
- If you approach a negotiation thinking the other party will think just like you you're wrong. That's projection -- not empathy
- All negotiation is an information gathering process
- The listener has control in a negotiation, not the talker
  - This is because the talker is revealing information about themselves
  - And the listener is guiding the talker with their questions
- Humanize yourself. What's the Sean discount?
- Whoever can be the most uncomfortable in a deal will win out in the end because you can hold out the longest
  - No deal is better than a bad deal
- From this book it seems like the best strategy in a monetary negotation is just to keep politely saying no in not so many words and have the counterparty bid against themselves
- Smiling when you speak is huge
- People trust you more when they find you as similar or familiar
- Negotiation is about becoming okay with conflict and handling it with empathy
- **Ask calibrated questions to lead your counterpart to get to your goals and have them think they discovered it themselves**

## Be a Mirror

- Your goal at the outset should be to extract as much information and observations as possible
  - Go in without any assumptions, but some hypothesis that each new piece of information tests
- Until you know who you are dealing with, don't make assumptions about them (they could be the real decision maker, etc.)
- Negotiation is not a battle of arguments -- you should be **listening**, not thinking of the arguments in your head
- The goal is to get your counterparts to tell you what they actually need, and make them feel safe in doing so
- Take the negotation slowly. Don't go too fast or you risk the other party not feeling heard and you undermine the rapport
- Often times your demeanor (calm, collected, etc.) is more important than the words you say
    - You generally want to be friendly and positive, relax and smile, etc.
    - If something isn't up for a matter of discussion, use a calm, but not aggresive tone that states it matter of factly. Don't offer an alternative
- *Mirroring* refers to just repeating the last three words (or critical words) back to the person you are talking to when they say something
  - This causes them to elaborate
  - e.g. "I'm sorry <mirrored words here> and then pause"
  - The intention behind this is to inform the other party, I'm sorry help me please understand
- **Mirroring is really powerful**
  - It gets your counterparty to keep talking and elaborating

## Don't Feel Their Pain, Label It

- Good negotiators identify emotions, label them, and influence them 
- You want to recognize the perspective of a counterpart and vocalize that recognition 
- *Labeling* is the way of validating someone's emotions by acknowledging it
  - "It seems like..."
  - "It sounds like..."
- After labeling something you want to go quiet and listen
  - The labels power is it gives the other person a chance to reveal themselves
  - "I'm sensing some hesitations with..."
- Sometimes the best way to diffuse a negative situation is to label the negative and lead with it
  - "Bless me father for I have sinned"
  - "I know you're scared"
  - "Look, I know I was wrong here"
- Never deny the negative (e.g. "I don't want this to sound harsh") and instead affirm it ("this is going to sound harsh")
- This can be a super powerful way to extract concessions from people that you need to extract
  - Premptively diffuse the situation ("You're going to think I'm the bad guy here")
  - Ask for their input with open ended questions and find out what they really want
- e.g. after an angry customer at a register: "Seems like they were quite angry", then start mirroring

## Master Saying "No"

- "No" starts the negotiation
  - It maintains the status quo and gives you a minute to pause and reconsider
  - If your counterparty says "no" that is a good thing! It can kick off the negotiation
  - You have to train yourself to hear "no" as something other than rejection
    - I am not ready to agree yet
    - I do not understand
    - I don't think I can afford it
    - I want something else
    - You are making me uncomfortable
    - etc.
- Sometimes you can disarm a negotiation from the start by telling someone they have the right to say no
  - Not sure how I feel about this
- After pausing when hearing a no, ask solution-based questions or simple label the no
- Getting a no out of the way quickly is a good way to let your counterpart feel like they are in control
  - This is why "is now a bad time to talk?" is always better than "is now a good time to talk"
- **Email response trick**
  - If someone has already ignored you once or twice, you can prompt a no "have you given up on this project?"
  
## Say the Most Two Important Words -- "That's Right"

- One crucial aspect of any negotation is to figure out how your adversary came to their position 
- **You have to get your counterpart to a position that will get them to say "that's right"**
  - e.g. they know you understand their position
  - that's right is obviously just an example -- there are many other ways someone can affirm you know what they are feeling
- One way to do this is to summarize -- not parrot -- what the person you are negotiating with is feeling
- Hearing "you're right" is a disaster
  - Someone may agree in theory but they don't own the conclusion
  - If you tell someone "you're right" it's an easy way to get them to go away so people do that

## Bend Their Reality

- There is always leverage, hidden blind spots, and undeveloped notions in a negotation
  - Even when you think you don't have leverage -- you have to find out what the other party wants/needs
- Compromising is never the best strategy (e.g. splitting the difference)
  - People compromise because it is safe
  - *Never split the difference*
- Deadlines are **powerful** in a negotiation
  - These are the screws that pressure deals to a conclusion
  - Resist the urge to force yourself into a deal at the deadline and take advantage of it in others
  - No deal is better than a bad deal
  - e.g. car dealers are prone to give you the best deal at the end of the month
    - Corportate salespeople who get paid quaterly are most vulnerable at the end of the month
- Deadlines are almost always arbitrary even when they feel immovable
- Judge threats by the specifics and specific timeline mentioned
  - If they are arbitrary, it's probably an early stage threat
- Hiding your deadlines is conventional wisdom but is actually wrong
  - Hiding your deadline pushes you to speed up concessions without the other party knowing where they hold out for more
- "Fairness" is a tricky concept. People tend to drop their rationality if they don't see a deal as fair
  - If someone says "we just want what's fair" the best response is to
    - Take a deep breath and restrain your desire to concede
    - Say let's stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfairly and we'll fix it"
- You can start a negotiation by telling your counterparty you want them to feel treated fairly at all times
  - This helps disarm the negotiation ahead of time
  - As a negotiator you want you reputation to be one of being fair
- You can play on loss aversion -- persuade the other side that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through
- The **context** of a situation matters a **ton**
  - e.g. if you frame someone's pay dropping from 2k to $500 that's terrible!
  - but if you frame it as an opportunity to not let the $500 go to someone else that's a better proposition
- Going second in a price negotiation is often the best, **just make sure** if they throw out a low offer that doesn't anchor you to a lower value
  - You don't need to make adjustments relative to the reference point
  - Sometimes it's worth it to go first if you both have experience and have a general idea of what the price should be
  - You can always use a range and allude to something else or someone in a similar situation besides yourself
    - If you offer a range expect them to come in at the low end
  - You can often pivot to non-monetary terms to get the negotiation in a place that both parties are happy with
- Sometimes giving a "gift" of some form (a small concession, a non-concession but nice thing) can be a good way to get your counterparty to feel like they have to repay you in some kind
- Before you make an offer, you can emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be (if the offer has to be bad)
- Good negotiators typically go in for an extreme anchor (extremely high or extremely low value) right off the bat to rattle you
  - Either don't let that rattle you, or use this to your advantage if moving first

### Salary Negotations

(Many of the above pieces of advice also apply here but in addition)

- Be pleasantly persistent with non-salary terms
  - If they can't bump the non-salary terms they might be compelled to bump the salary
- When someone throws out a number, you don't have to respond immediately
  - Label, mirror, etc.
  - Even if someone increases their offer, you can keep going since they are negotiating against themselves

## Create the Illusion of Control

- You want your counterpart to be coaxed into the conclusion you want, thinking they did it themselves
- Ask open ended questions to help drive your outcome
  - For example, in the hostage negotiation to get the hostage on the phone
    - Don't say, is the hostage alive?
    - Ask, how do I know they are alright?
      - Your counterpart may drive this for you
  - "How am I supposed to do that?" then going silent is a **classic** (you have to legitamately ask for help, not in a bullying tone)
  - Open ended questions should **not** be accusational
- Calibrated open ended questions have a direction that you can use to help drive your counterparty to an outcome you agree on
  - Asking "why" questions often sound accusationary
- You can't let your emotions control you in a negotiation
  - Always pause, think, and collect your thoughts
- When people don't feel in control, they adopt a "hostage" mentality
- "How can we pay that much?"
  - This is an open ended question but denies the offer without saying "no"
- With how questions, you convince the counterparty that the solution is their ideas when they answer
  the how 
- You can say "no" in many different ways without saying the word "no"
  - e.g. "That was a very generous offer but I can't come up with the money"
  - e.g. "The price you offered was very fair but I can't afford it"

## Guarantee Execution

- The goal isnt' just to get to an agreement. It's to get to an agreement that you know can be executed
- Implementation often requires more than just your negotiating counterparty. You have to get everyone bought in

## Bargain Hard

- You have to understand your counterparty's style
  - Are they assertive?
  - Are they an analyst?
  - Are they an accomadator? Who wants to be friendly and is seeking a win-win?
- When a negotiation is far from resolved and is going nowehere, sometimes you have to be aggressive to get things moving
  - Calm anger + frustration if it is real can sometimes be warranted
- To get yourself out of a bad dynamic you can use "I"
  - e.g. "I feel <blank> when you <blank>"
- The person at the other end of the table is never your enemy -- the unsolved issue is

### Haggling

- Sometimes you find yourself face-to-face with a hard haggler
- You can use the Ackerman method
  - Set your target price (what you want to pay, **not** the max you'll pay)
  - Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price
  - Calculate 3 raises to 85, 95, and 100%
  - Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying "No" to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer
  - At the final number use precise numbers (e.g. $1536 rather than $1500) to give the final number credibility and weight
    - On your final number throw in a nonmonetary item to show you're at your limit
  
### Find the Black Swan

- These are the *unknown unknowns* whose unearthing has a game-changing effect on the negotiation dynamic
- When bits and pieces of a story don't add up, it's usually because our frames of reference are off and we need to break free of our expectations
- The author's hypothesis is that in each negotiation each side has around 3 black swans that would change everything
