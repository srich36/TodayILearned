## Bitmaps

- A string of *n* binary digits (0's and 1's) that can be used to represent the status of *n* different items
  - 1 if complete, 0 if not, etc.
  - The digit at the *ith* position represents the status of the *ith* item
  - This drops an 8 bit boolean value down to being represented with 1 bit - good when you must be really space efficient

## CPU Scheduling

- Red Black tree (balanced binary search tree)
