# General

- Linux used to use something similar to semantic versioning, now the version numbering is arbitrary and just indicates release order
- Linux is GPL -> no one using Linux can use it without distributing the source
- Kernel code executes in the processors *priveleged* mode
- BGP populates the routing table of routers
- Once TCP/IP packets are received by a system they are sent to the right process by the port number
    - TCP/UDP provides this port extension of IP
