In this way you can configure something like `nginx` to be a load balancer as it receives incoming requests and load balances them to different server instances.\n\n### Forward Proxy\n\nFor a `forward proxy` client requests immediately go through a proxy server which then routes those requests to the domain specified in the request. This domain then may point to a `reverse proxy` which routes the requests to different microservices in the application.\n\n### Microservice Architecture\n\nA collection of instances, db, cache, application server, that are isolated (mostly in Docker containers) and can communicate with each other on the network. If you have a microservice application server for example, you can load balance incoming requests (e.g. through an `nginx` configuration) to the different application server instances on the network. This allows you to `horizontally scale` your application as you can easily spin up new instances of whatever layer, application server, db, etc. that needs more computing power.\n\n### Sidecar Paradigm (ngnix)\n\nSidecars are a way of structuring application architectures so that for individual microservices to talk to one another they have to go through a proxy (called a sidecar). This allows you to take all the ssl and policy management out of the application themselves, and instead have something like `nginx` working as a `reverse proxy` applying access policies between services. For more information see the Software Engineering Daily podcast on sidecars.\n\n# Deployments\n\n### Static Files\n\nStatic files are files that change very infrequently from request to request. As such, they can be cached upon retrieval since you know that they won't change on the next request (The browser and something like Cloudfront handle this for you). Thus, the best way to deploy static files is to put them in an s3 bucket (which auto-scales) and have something like Cloudfront in front of it which is a CDN. Cloudfront will cache the static files at its point of access in the network making for faster retrieval time and reducing load on the s3 bucket. If no cache of the files exist, it will go to the s3 bucket and retrieve it. To configure this, all you need to do is point Cloudfront to your s3 bucket, and point your domain name to Cloudfront.\n\n### Load Balancer\n\nAt its core, a load balancer simply accepts incoming traffic and routes it to a number of different application instances. Since it is what is accepting and routing traffic, this acts as a **reverse proxy** and thus can take the role of what nginx does. These incoming requests can then be routed to application instances running with something like `gunicorn` for `Django`. Note that nginx can easily configured as a load balancer too, but if you use an elastic load balancer from AWS you do not need it. This is because when running `nginx` as a reverse proxy something else acts as the web server and serves the responses (e.g. a `Django` app). Were you using `nginx` to serve files like `index.html` and not as a reverse proxy, then you would need to route the load balancer to the `nginx` instance.\n\n# Overall Flow for Decouple Frontend and Backend App\n\n## Frontend\n\nOn push to master, build the frontend distribution files and sync them to an s3 bucket. Put cloudfront in front of the s3 bucket and route all traffic to cloudfront. Then direct any traffic to your domain name to your cloudfront instance. Point your cloudfront instance to your s3 bucket. When a request comes to cloudfront it will either return the cached static file version, or get it from the s3 bucket, cache it, then return that. This reduces load on the s3 bucket and can handle a very very high amount of traffic effectively because s3 scales and accepts requests automatically.\n\n## Backend\n\n### Database\n\nCreate a database instance using one of AWS's database services. It is never a good idea to try to manage your own database instance containerized or whatever as this can potentially lead to serious data loss issues. This database will have a set of credentials for connecting to it that can be passed in as environment variables to the application instances.\n\n### Application servers\n\nCreate a load balancer with a rule/listener to route all traffic to a certain target group. This target group will be comprised of autos-scaled instances running a specified task definition. The task definition will likely be running a specified Dockerfile that is built and pushed to Amazon's ECR with CI/CD. In this task definition you will pass in the database connection environment variables. The target group - a target is an instance - handles the scaling up and down of all the instances and the load balancing of traffic between the auto-scaled instances.\n",

      "content": "# Django Basics\n\n\n### Authentication Backends\n\nAuthentication backends in Django are simply classes that implement `get_user` and `authenticate` methods given a primary key and credentials respectively. If multiple authentication backends are specified in the configuration, Django will try all available backends until a successful authentication is found\n\n### Custom User Models\n\nIt is recommended to create a custom user model whenever you are starting a new Django project. To maintain all the built in functionality of password hashing, etc you can inherit from `BaseUser` and point `AUTH_USER_MODEL` to the custom user\n\n### Automatic Primary Keys\n\nBy default Django gives every table the field `id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)` which is an auto updating primary key\n\n### Random Tidbits\n\n- For an app that doesn't have a migrations directory yet, e.g. and app that is just created, you have to run `python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>`\n\n### Meta Classes\n\n##### Models\n\nMeta classes in models represent anything that is not a field, e.g. ordering, column names, etc.\n\n### Model Managers\n\nModel Managers are the most important part of the model as they retrieve instances from the database and provide the database queries. The default model manager is called `objects` and can be referenced by `<model_name>.objects` if not overriden\n\n### Model Logic\n\nIt is best practice to include necessary simple custom model functions in the models. These can go with other model functions such as `__str__` and can be referenced by `<model_Instance>.<method_name>;`\n\n### Pre-defined model methods\n\nDjango provides pre-defined model methods such as `save()` and `delete()` than can be overridden in the model class by simply redefining `save(*args, **kwargs)` and `save(*args, **kwargs)`. Calling `super(*args, **kwargs)` in this methods will ensure the data still gets saved.\n\nTheses pre-defined methods are why, given an example model `Post`\n\n```\nb = Post(text)\nb.save()\n```\n\nsaves a new Post to the database. `save` will update a model if it already exists.\n\nI believe `Post(text)` provides a constructor that can also be accessed by `Post.objects.create(text)`\n\n## Querysets\n\nA query set is essentially a `select` SQL statement with as many filters as desired which act as the `where` statement. Querysets come from the model's manager and thus NOT a model instance.\n\n**A queryset does not actually hit the database until it is iterated through or another form of evaluation.** `<Model></Model>.objects.all()` **will not evaluate the queryset and thus will not hit the database**\n\nYou can easily chain queryset filters together. This chaining is immutable and returns a new queryset every time\n\n## General Tips\n\n- It may be best to avoid signals since they are hard to track down and hard to debug\n- Go \"top to bottom\" with urls \n  - e.g. plans/\\<plan_number\\>/approvals to get all the approvals for a plan\n- To add a `unique=True` field to tables with rows:\n  1. Create migration to add a field without `unique=True`\n  2. Create migration to populate existing fields with UUIDs\n  3. Alter field to include unique option\n    - This is necessary because the initial field value will only be evaluated once when applied to all of the rows, thus it will fail the duplication constraint\n- `safe=False` is required in a `JsonResponse` whenever the object you are trying to serialize is not a dictionary\n  - `DRF` returns a dictionary type called a `ReturnDict`\n- If you are ever getting import errors when you shouldn't be, there might be a circular dependency\n  - You can't have a model depend on an external file, then have that external file depend on the model\n- When you are serializing an array of items with `DRF` you need the flag `many=True`\n",

Instances of meta classes can be used to define class behavior. Not a ton of languages support meta classes and the implementations differ (Python does).\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n\nPython3 (and 2) supports keyword arguments e.g. `myFunc(b=2, a=1)` where the order of the parameters passed doesn't matter. The above is equivalent to `myFunc(a=1, b=2)`. You can mandate arguments be passed as keywords\n\n### Python \\* Operator\n\n\\*args unpacks an iteratable object into its individual items. For example, if args = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], \\*args will become 1,2,3,4. This is the same as the spread operator `...` in Javascript. This is argument `unpacking` it unpacks an iterable object into its individual components\n\n### Python \\*\\* Operator\n\nSimilar to the \\* operator \\*\\* unpacks a dictionary into keyword arguments. If `dict = {a: 1, b: 2}` then `**dict` turns into a=1, b=2. Thus in a function myFunc(\\*\\*dict) this is transformed into named keyword arguments with `myFunc(a=1, b=2)`\n\n### Decorators\n\n### Function Basics\n\nFunctions are first class objects in python. This means they can be passed around as arguments, etc. In general, a first class object is an object that has all the rights and abilities as other variables in the programming languages. Things that can't be passed as arguments, e.g. functions in `C` are called second-class arguments.\n\nYou can define functions inside other functions - these are called `inner functions`. Inner functions are not defined until their parent function is called. They are locally scoped to the parent function.\n\nYou can also return functions from other functions. Just like in JavaScript, the function name refers to the function itself where invoking it returns the value\n\nDecorators just wrap a function and modify its behavior. What this does is calls a function by passing in a function which then returns a new modified function. The `@` symbol is syntactic sugar for this entire thing. So `@<decorator_function>` above another function will pass the function that is below it into `<decorator_function>` and the function below it will then have the modified behavior when called.\n\nThis may not have been worded the best so here is an example:\n\n```python\ndef do_twice(func):\n    def wrapper_do_twice(*args, **kwargs):\n        func(*args, **kwargs)\n        func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper_do_twice\n\n@do_twice\ndef printWord(word):\n    print(word)\n```\n\nCalling `printWord` will now print the word twice. You always want to include `*args, **kwargs` in decorators so you can pass in an arbitrary number of arguments.\n\n### Introspection vs Reflection\n\n`Introspection` is the ability for an object to know about itself at runtime. `Reflection` is one step further: the ability to modify itself at runtime.\n\n### General Tips\n\n- To get a value from a tuple you can convert to a dictionary and then use the get method\n- Set: A collection that is unordered, unindexed, and unique\n- Python 3.5+ supports type hints\n  - `def my_func(num: int) -> str:`",

Thus, `traceroute` was written to find all the hops a packet takes between destinations.\n\nAdditionally, each IP datagram has a `TTL` (Time to life) field that is used to prevent packets from getting into routing loops.

When `TTL` gets to 1, if the router cannot forward the packet to its finally destination it discards the packet and sends a timeout error with its IP address to the original packet source address.\n\n# Traceroute\n\n`traceroute` takes advantage of this `TTL` expiration by creating packets with incrementing `TTL's`, starting at 1. Therefore, each successive packet reaches one further hop and gets the router IP address at which the `TTL` expired. So by creating and sending packets with `TTL's` of 1,2,3...,n where n is the unknown number of hops to get to the end destination (you know it reached the end destination because the destination system will send back a port unreachable error because `traceroute` picks a destination port of 30000+ which the destination system is very unlikely to have a program running on), you can map the entire route a packet takes.\n\n# Routing\n\n- Routing tables define where packets should be sent based on destination addresses.

The packet then goes through multiple hops in this same fashion, until the last router has a matching entry for the destination address\n- Hosts build up routing knowledge through ICMP redirects being returned to them (and then adding the corresponding routes as shown by netstat).

So by creating and sending packets with <code>TTL's</code> of 1,2,3…,n where n is the unknown number of hops to get to the end destination (you know it reached the end destination because the destination system will send back a port unreachable error because <code>traceroute</code> picks a destination port of 30000+ which the destination system is very unlikely to have a program running on), you can map the entire route a packet takes.</p>\n<h1 id=\"routing\">Routing <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#routing\">#</a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Routing tables define where packets should be sent based on destination addresses. For most internet packets they go through a default entry which is a router connected to the internet. The packet then goes through multiple hops in this same fashion, until the last router has a matching entry for the destination address</li>\n<li>Hosts build up routing knowledge through ICMP redirects being returned to them (and then adding the corresponding routes as shown by netstat). The rest of the routing knowledge is contained in routers</li>\n</ul>\n",
